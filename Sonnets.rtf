From fairest creatures we desire increase,\uc0\u8232 That thereby beauty's rose might never die,\u8232 But as the riper should by time decease,\u8232 His tender heir might bear his memory:\u8232 But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,\u8232 Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,\u8232 Making a famine where abundance lies,\u8232 Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:\u8232 Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,\u8232 And only herald to the gaudy spring,\u8232 Within thine own bud buriest thy content,\u8232 And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding:\u8232 Pity the world, or else this glutton be,\u8232 To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.\
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,\uc0\u8232 And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,\u8232 Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,\u8232 Will be a totter'd weed of small worth held:\u8232 Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,\u8232 Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;\u8232 To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,\u8232 Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.\u8232 How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,\u8232 If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine\u8232 Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,\u8232 Proving his beauty by succession thine!\u8232 This were to be new made when thou art old,\u8232 And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.\
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest\uc0\u8232 Now is the time that face should form another;\u8232 Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,\u8232 Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.\u8232 For where is she so fair whose uneared womb\u8232 Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?\u8232 Or who is he so fond will be the tomb\u8232 Of his self-love, to stop posterity?\u8232 Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee\u8232 Calls back the lovely April of her prime;\u8232 So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,\u8232 Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.\u8232 But if thou live, remembered not to be,\u8232 Die single and thine image dies with thee.\
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend\uc0\u8232 Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?\u8232 Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,\u8232 And being frank she lends to those are free:\u8232 Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse\u8232 The bounteous largess given thee to give?\u8232 Profitless usurer, why dost thou use\u8232 So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?\u8232 For having traffic with thy self alone,\u8232 Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:\u8232 Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,\u8232 What acceptable audit canst thou leave?\u8232 Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,\u8232 Which, used, lives th' executor to be.\
Those hours, that with gentle work did frame\uc0\u8232 The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,\u8232 Will play the tyrants to the very same\u8232 And that unfair which fairly doth excel;\u8232 For never-resting time leads summer on\u8232 To hideous winter, and confounds him there;\u8232 Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,\u8232 Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:\u8232 Then were not summer's distillation left,\u8232 A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\u8232 Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,\u8232 Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:\u8232 But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,\u8232 Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.\
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,\uc0\u8232 In thee thy summer, ere thou be distilled:\u8232 Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place\u8232 With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed.\u8232 That use is not forbidden usury,\u8232 Which happies those that pay the willing loan;\u8232 That's for thy self to breed another thee,\u8232 Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;\u8232 Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,\u8232 If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:\u8232 Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,\u8232 Leaving thee living in posterity?\u8232 Be not self-willed, for thou art much too fair\u8232 To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.\
Lo! in the orient when the gracious light\uc0\u8232 Lifts up his burning head, each under eye\u8232 Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,\u8232 Serving with looks his sacred majesty;\u8232 And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,\u8232 Resembling strong youth in his middle age,\u8232 Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,\u8232 Attending on his golden pilgrimage:\u8232 But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,\u8232 Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,\u8232 The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are\u8232 From his low tract, and look another way:\u8232 So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon\u8232 Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.\
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?\uc0\u8232 Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:\u8232 Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,\u8232 Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?\u8232 If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\u8232 By unions married, do offend thine ear,\u8232 They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds\u8232 In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.\u8232 Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,\u8232 Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;\u8232 Resembling sire and child and happy mother,\u8232 Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:\u8232 Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,\u8232 Sings this to thee: Thou single wilt prove none.\
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,\uc0\u8232 That thou consum'st thy self in single life?\u8232 Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,\u8232 The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;\u8232 The world will be thy widow and still weep\u8232 That thou no form of thee hast left behind,\u8232 When every private widow well may keep\u8232 By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:\u8232 Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend\u8232 Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\u8232 But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,\u8232 And kept unused the user so destroys it.\u8232 No love toward others in that bosom sits\u8232 That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.\
For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any,\uc0\u8232 Who for thy self art so unprovident.\u8232 Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,\u8232 But that thou none lov'st is most evident:\u8232 For thou art so possessed with murderous hate,\u8232 That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,\u8232 Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate\u8232 Which to repair should be thy chief desire.\u8232 O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:\u8232 Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?\u8232 Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,\u8232 Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:\u8232 Make thee another self for love of me,\u8232 That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\
As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st\uc0\u8232 In one of thine, from that which thou departest;\u8232 And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,\u8232 Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.\u8232 Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;\u8232 Without this folly, age, and cold decay:\u8232 If all were minded so, the times should cease\u8232 And threescore year would make the world away.\u8232 Let those whom nature hath not made for store,\u8232 Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:\u8232 Look whom she best endowed, she gave the more;\u8232 Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:\u8232 She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,\u8232 Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.\
When I do count the clock that tells the time,\uc0\u8232 And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;\u8232 When I behold the violet past prime,\u8232 And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;\u8232 When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\u8232 Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,\u8232 And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,\u8232 Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,\u8232 Then of thy beauty do I question make,\u8232 That thou among the wastes of time must go,\u8232 Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake\u8232 And die as fast as they see others grow;\u8232 And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence\u8232 Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.\
O! that you were your self; but, love, you are\uc0\u8232 No longer yours, than you your self here live:\u8232 Against this coming end you should prepare,\u8232 And your sweet semblance to some other give:\u8232 So should that beauty which you hold in lease\u8232 Find no determination; then you were\u8232 Yourself again, after yourself's decease,\u8232 When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.\u8232 Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,\u8232 Which husbandry in honour might uphold,\u8232 Against the stormy gusts of winter's day\u8232 And barren rage of death's eternal cold?\u8232 O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,\u8232 You had a father: let your son say so.\
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;\uc0\u8232 And yet methinks I have Astronomy,\u8232 But not to tell of good or evil luck,\u8232 Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;\u8232 Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,\u8232 Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,\u8232 Or say with princes if it shall go well\u8232 By oft predict that I in heaven find:\u8232 But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,\u8232 And, constant stars, in them I read such art\u8232 As truth and beauty shall together thrive,\u8232 If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert;\u8232 Or else of thee this I prognosticate:\u8232 Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.\
When I consider every thing that grows\uc0\u8232 Holds in perfection but a little moment,\u8232 That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows\u8232 Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;\u8232 When I perceive that men as plants increase,\u8232 Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,\u8232 Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,\u8232 And wear their brave state out of memory;\u8232 Then the conceit of this inconstant stay\u8232 Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,\u8232 Where wasteful Time debateth with decay\u8232 To change your day of youth to sullied night,\u8232 And all in war with Time for love of you,\u8232 As he takes from you, I engraft you new.\
But wherefore do not you a mightier way\uc0\u8232 Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?\u8232 And fortify your self in your decay\u8232 With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?\u8232 Now stand you on the top of happy hours,\u8232 And many maiden gardens, yet unset,\u8232 With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,\u8232 Much liker than your painted counterfeit:\u8232 So should the lines of life that life repair,\u8232 Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,\u8232 Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,\u8232 Can make you live your self in eyes of men.\u8232 To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,\u8232 And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.\
Who will believe my verse in time to come,\uc0\u8232 If it were filled with your most high deserts?\u8232 Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb\u8232 Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.\u8232 If I could write the beauty of your eyes,\u8232 And in fresh numbers number all your graces,\u8232 The age to come would say 'This poet lies;\u8232 Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.\u8232 So should my papers, yellowed with their age,\u8232 Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,\u8232 And your true rights be termed a poet's rage\u8232 And stretched metre of an antique song:\u8232 But were some child of yours alive that time,\u8232 You should live twice, in it, and in my rhyme.\
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\uc0\u8232 Thou art more lovely and more temperate:\u8232 Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\u8232 And summer's lease hath all too short a date:\u8232 Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\u8232 And often is his gold complexion dimmed,\u8232 And every fair from fair sometime declines,\u8232 By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:\u8232 But thy eternal summer shall not fade,\u8232 Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,\u8232 Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\u8232 When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,\u8232 So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\u8232 So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\
Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,\uc0\u8232 And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;\u8232 Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,\u8232 And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;\u8232 Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,\u8232 And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,\u8232 To the wide world and all her fading sweets;\u8232 But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:\u8232 O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,\u8232 Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;\u8232 Him in thy course untainted do allow\u8232 For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.\u8232 Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,\u8232 My love shall in my verse ever live young.\
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,\uc0\u8232 Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;\u8232 A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted\u8232 With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:\u8232 An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,\u8232 Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;\u8232 A man in hue all hues in his controlling,\u8232 Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.\u8232 And for a woman wert thou first created;\u8232 Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,\u8232 And by addition me of thee defeated,\u8232 By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.\u8232 But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,\u8232 Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.\
So is it not with me as with that Muse,\uc0\u8232 Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,\u8232 Who heaven itself for ornament doth use\u8232 And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,\u8232 Making a couplement of proud compare\u8232 With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,\u8232 With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,\u8232 That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.\u8232 O! let me, true in love, but truly write,\u8232 And then believe me, my love is as fair\u8232 As any mother's child, though not so bright\u8232 As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:\u8232 Let them say more that like of hearsay well;\u8232 I will not praise that purpose not to sell.\
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,\uc0\u8232 So long as youth and thou are of one date;\u8232 But when in thee time's furrows I behold,\u8232 Then look I death my days should expiate.\u8232 For all that beauty that doth cover thee,\u8232 Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,\u8232 Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:\u8232 How can I then be elder than thou art?\u8232 O! therefore, love, be of thyself so wary\u8232 As I, not for myself, but for thee will;\u8232 Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary\u8232 As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.\u8232 Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,\u8232 Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.\
As an unperfect actor on the stage,\uc0\u8232 Who with his fear is put beside his part,\u8232 Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\u8232 Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;\u8232 So I, for fear of trust, forget to say\u8232 The perfect ceremony of love's rite,\u8232 And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,\u8232 O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might.\u8232 O! let my looks be then the eloquence\u8232 And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,\u8232 Who plead for love, and look for recompense,\u8232 More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.\u8232 O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:\u8232 To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.\
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath steeled,\uc0\u8232 Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;\u8232 My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,\u8232 And perspective that is best painter's art.\u8232 For through the painter must you see his skill,\u8232 To find where your true image pictured lies,\u8232 Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,\u8232 That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.\u8232 Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:\u8232 Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me\u8232 Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun\u8232 Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;\u8232 Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,\u8232 They draw but what they see, know not the heart.\
Let those who are in favour with their stars\uc0\u8232 Of public honour and proud titles boast,\u8232 Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars\u8232 Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.\u8232 Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread\u8232 But as the marigold at the sun's eye,\u8232 And in themselves their pride lies buried,\u8232 For at a frown they in their glory die.\u8232 The painful warrior famoused for fight,\u8232 After a thousand victories once foiled,\u8232 Is from the book of honour razed quite,\u8232 And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:\u8232 Then happy I, that love and am beloved,\u8232 Where I may not remove nor be removed.\
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage\uc0\u8232 Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,\u8232 To thee I send this written embassage,\u8232 To witness duty, not to show my wit:\u8232 Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine\u8232 May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,\u8232 But that I hope some good conceit of thine\u8232 In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:\u8232 Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,\u8232 Points on me graciously with fair aspect,\u8232 And puts apparel on my tottered loving,\u8232 To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:\u8232 Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;\u8232 Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.\
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,\uc0\u8232 The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;\u8232 But then begins a journey in my head\u8232 To work my mind, when body's work's expired:\u8232 For then my thoughts--from far where I abide\u8232 Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,\u8232 And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,\u8232 Looking on darkness which the blind do see:\u8232 Save that my soul's imaginary sight\u8232 Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,\u8232 Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,\u8232 Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.\u8232 Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,\u8232 For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.\
How can I then return in happy plight,\uc0\u8232 That am debarred the benefit of rest?\u8232 When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,\u8232 But day by night and night by day oppressed,\u8232 And each, though enemies to either's reign,\u8232 Do in consent shake hands to torture me,\u8232 The one by toil, the other to complain\u8232 How far I toil, still farther off from thee.\u8232 I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,\u8232 And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:\u8232 So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,\u8232 When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.\u8232 But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,\u8232 And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.\
When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes\uc0\u8232 I all alone beweep my outcast state,\u8232 And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\u8232 And look upon myself, and curse my fate,\u8232 Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,\u8232 Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,\u8232 Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,\u8232 With what I most enjoy contented least;\u8232 Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,\u8232 Haply I think on thee, and then my state,\u8232 Like to the lark at break of day arising\u8232 From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;\u8232 For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings\u8232 That then I scorn to change my state with kings.\
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought\uc0\u8232 I summon up remembrance of things past,\u8232 I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,\u8232 And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:\u8232 Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,\u8232 For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,\u8232 And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,\u8232 And moan the expense of many a vanished sight:\u8232 Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,\u8232 And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er\u8232 The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\u8232 Which I new pay as if not paid before.\u8232 But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,\u8232 All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.\
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,\uc0\u8232 Which I by lacking have supposed dead;\u8232 And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,\u8232 And all those friends which I thought buried.\u8232 How many a holy and obsequious tear\u8232 Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,\u8232 As interest of the dead, which now appear\u8232 But things removed that hidden in thee lie!\u8232 Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,\u8232 Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,\u8232 Who all their parts of me to thee did give,\u8232 That due of many now is thine alone:\u8232 Their images I loved, I view in thee,\u8232 And thou all they hast all the all of me.\
If thou survive my well-contented day,\uc0\u8232 When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover\u8232 And shalt by fortune once more re-survey\u8232 These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,\u8232 Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,\u8232 And though they be outstripped by every pen,\u8232 Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,\u8232 Exceeded by the height of happier men.\u8232 O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:\u8232 'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,\u8232 A dearer birth than this his love had brought,\u8232 To march in ranks of better equipage:\u8232 But since he died and poets better prove,\u8232 Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.\
Full many a glorious morning have I seen\uc0\u8232 Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,\u8232 Kissing with golden face the meadows green,\u8232 Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;\u8232 Anon permit the basest clouds to ride\u8232 With ugly rack on his celestial face,\u8232 And from the forlorn world his visage hide,\u8232 Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:\u8232 Even so my sun one early morn did shine,\u8232 With all triumphant splendour on my brow;\u8232 But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,\u8232 The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.\u8232 Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;\u8232 Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.\
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,\uc0\u8232 And make me travel forth without my cloak,\u8232 To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,\u8232 Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?\u8232 'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,\u8232 To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,\u8232 For no man well of such a salve can speak,\u8232 That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:\u8232 Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;\u8232 Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:\u8232 The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief\u8232 To him that bears the strong offence's cross.\u8232 Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,\u8232 And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.\
No more be grieved atthat which thou hast done:\uc0\u8232 Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:\u8232 Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,\u8232 And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.\u8232 All men make faults, and even I in this,\u8232 Authorizing thy trespass with compare,\u8232 Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,\u8232 Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;\u8232 For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,\u8232 Thy adverse party is thy advocate,\u8232 And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:\u8232 Such civil war is in my love and hate,\u8232 That I an accessary needs must be,\u8232 To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.\
Let me confess that we two must be twain,\uc0\u8232 Although our undivided loves are one:\u8232 So shall those blots that do with me remain,\u8232 Without thy help, by me be borne alone.\u8232 In our two loves there is but one respect,\u8232 Though in our lives a separable spite,\u8232 Which though it alter not love's sole effect,\u8232 Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.\u8232 I may not evermore acknowledge thee,\u8232 Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,\u8232 Nor thou with public kindness honour me,\u8232 Unless thou take that honour from thy name:\u8232 But do not so, I love thee in such sort,\u8232 As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\
As a decrepit father takes delight\uc0\u8232 To see his active child do deeds of youth,\u8232 So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,\u8232 Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;\u8232 For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,\u8232 Or any of these all, or all, or more,\u8232 Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,\u8232 I make my love engrafted to this store:\u8232 So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,\u8232 Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give\u8232 That I in thy abundance am sufficed,\u8232 And by a part of all thy glory live.\u8232 Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:\u8232 This wish I have; then ten times happy me!\
How can my muse want subject to invent,\uc0\u8232 While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse\u8232 Thine own sweet argument, too excellent\u8232 For every vulgar paper to rehearse?\u8232 O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me\u8232 Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;\u8232 For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,\u8232 When thou thy self dost give invention light?\u8232 Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth\u8232 Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;\u8232 And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth\u8232 Eternal numbers to outlive long date.\u8232 If my slight muse do please these curious days,\u8232 The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.\
O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,\uc0\u8232 When thou art all the better part of me?\u8232 What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?\u8232 And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?\u8232 Even for this, let us divided live,\u8232 And our dear love lose name of single one,\u8232 That by this separation I may give\u8232 That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.\u8232 O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,\u8232 Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,\u8232 To entertain the time with thoughts of love,\u8232 Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,\u8232 And that thou teachest how to make one twain,\u8232 By praising him here who doth hence remain.\
Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;\uc0\u8232 What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?\u8232 No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;\u8232 All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.\u8232 Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,\u8232 I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;\u8232 But yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest\u8232 By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.\u8232 I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,\u8232 Although thou steal thee all my poverty:\u8232 And yet, love knows it is a greater grief\u8232 To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.\u8232 Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,\u8232 Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.\
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,\uc0\u8232 When I am sometime absent from thy heart,\u8232 Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,\u8232 For still temptation follows where thou art.\u8232 Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,\u8232 Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;\u8232 And when a woman woos, what woman's son\u8232 Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?\u8232 Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,\u8232 And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,\u8232 Who lead thee in their riot even there\u8232 Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:\u8232 Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,\u8232 Thine by thy beauty being false to me.\
That thou hast her it is not all my grief,\uc0\u8232 And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;\u8232 That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,\u8232 A loss in love that touches me more nearly.\u8232 Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:\u8232 Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;\u8232 And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,\u8232 Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.\u8232 If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,\u8232 And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;\u8232 Both find each other, and I lose both twain,\u8232 And both for my sake lay on me this cross:\u8232 But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;\u8232 Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.\
When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,\uc0\u8232 For all the day they view things unrespected;\u8232 But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,\u8232 And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.\u8232 Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,\u8232 How would thy shadow's form form happy show\u8232 To the clear day with thy much clearer light,\u8232 When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!\u8232 How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made\u8232 By looking on thee in the living day,\u8232 When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade\u8232 Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!\u8232 All days are nights to see till I see thee,\u8232 And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.\
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,\uc0\u8232 Injurious distance should not stop my way;\u8232 For then despite of space I would be brought,\u8232 From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.\u8232 No matter then although my foot did stand\u8232 Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;\u8232 For nimble thought can jump both sea and land\u8232 As soon as think the place where he would be.\u8232 But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,\u8232 To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,\u8232 But that, so much of earth and water wrought,\u8232 I must attend time's leisure with my moan,\u8232 Receiving nought by elements so slow\u8232 But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.\
The other two, slight air and purging fire,\uc0\u8232 Are both with thee, wherever I abide;\u8232 The first my thought, the other my desire,\u8232 These present-absent with swift motion slide.\u8232 For when these quicker elements are gone\u8232 In tender embassy of love to thee,\u8232 My life, being made of four, with two alone\u8232 Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy;\u8232 Until life's composition be recured\u8232 By those swift messengers return'd from thee,\u8232 Who even but now come back again, assured\u8232 Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:\u8232 This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,\u8232 I send them back again and straight grow sad.\
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,\uc0\u8232 How to divide the conquest of thy sight;\u8232 Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,\u8232 My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.\u8232 My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,\u8232 A closet never pierced with crystal eyes,\u8232 But the defendant doth that plea deny,\u8232 And says in him thy fair appearance lies.\u8232 To 'cide this title is impannelled\u8232 A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;\u8232 And by their verdict is determined\u8232 The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:\u8232 As thus: mine eye's due is thine outward part,\u8232 And my heart's right, thine inward love of heart.\
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,\uc0\u8232 And each doth good turns now unto the other:\u8232 When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,\u8232 Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,\u8232 With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,\u8232 And to the painted banquet bids my heart;\u8232 Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,\u8232 And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:\u8232 So, either by thy picture or my love,\u8232 Thy self away, art present still with me;\u8232 For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,\u8232 And I am still with them, and they with thee;\u8232 Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight\u8232 Awakes my heart, to heart's and eyes' delight.\
How careful was I when I took my way,\uc0\u8232 Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,\u8232 That to my use it might unused stay\u8232 From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!\u8232 But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,\u8232 Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,\u8232 Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,\u8232 Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.\u8232 Thee have I not locked up in any chest,\u8232 Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,\u8232 Within the gentle closure of my breast,\u8232 From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;\u8232 And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,\u8232 For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.\
Against that time, if ever that time come,\uc0\u8232 When I shall see thee frown on my defects,\u8232 When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,\u8232 Called to that audit by advis'd respects;\u8232 Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,\u8232 And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,\u8232 When love, converted from the thing it was,\u8232 Shall reasons find of settled gravity;\u8232 Against that time do I ensconce me here,\u8232 Within the knowledge of mine own desert,\u8232 And this my hand, against my self uprear,\u8232 To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:\u8232 To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,\u8232 Since why to love I can allege no cause.\
How heavy do I journey on the way,\uc0\u8232 When what I seek, my weary travel's end,\u8232 Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,\u8232 Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend\u8232 The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,\u8232 Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,\u8232 As if by some instinct the wretch did know\u8232 His rider lov'd not speed being made from thee.\u8232 The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,\u8232 That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,\u8232 Which heavily he answers with a groan,\u8232 More sharp to me than spurring to his side;\u8232 For that same groan doth put this in my mind,\u8232 My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.\
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence\uc0\u8232 Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:\u8232 From where thou art why should I haste me thence?\u8232 Till I return, of posting is no need.\u8232 O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,\u8232 When swift extremity can seem but slow?\u8232 Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,\u8232 In winged speed no motion shall I know,\u8232 Then can no horse with my desire keep pace.\u8232 Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made\u8232 Shall neigh, no dull flesh, in his fiery race;\u8232 But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade-\u8232 Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,\u8232 Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.\
So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,\uc0\u8232 Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,\u8232 The which he will not every hour survey,\u8232 For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.\u8232 Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,\u8232 Since, seldom coming in the long year set,\u8232 Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,\u8232 Or captain jewels in the carcanet.\u8232 So is the time that keeps you as my chest,\u8232 Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,\u8232 To make some special instant special-blest,\u8232 By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.\u8232 Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,\u8232 Being had, to triumph, being lacked, to hope.\
What is your substance, whereof are you made,\uc0\u8232 That millions of strange shadows on you tend?\u8232 Since every one hath, every one, one shade,\u8232 And you but one, can every shadow lend.\u8232 Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit\u8232 Is poorly imitated after you;\u8232 On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,\u8232 And you in Grecian tires are painted new:\u8232 Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,\u8232 The one doth shadow of your beauty show,\u8232 The other as your bounty doth appear;\u8232 And you in every blessed shape we know.\u8232 In all external grace you have some part,\u8232 But you like none, none you, for constant heart.\
O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem\uc0\u8232 By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.\u8232 The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem\u8232 For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.\u8232 The canker blooms have full as deep a dye\u8232 As the perfumed tincture of the roses,\u8232 Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly\u8232 When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:\u8232 But, for their virtue only is their show,\u8232 They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;\u8232 Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;\u8232 Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:\u8232 And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,\u8232 When that shall vade, my verse distills your truth.\
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments\uc0\u8232 Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;\u8232 But you shall shine more bright in these contents\u8232 Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.\u8232 When wasteful war shall statues overturn,\u8232 And broils root out the work of masonry,\u8232 Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn\u8232 The living record of your memory.\u8232 'Gainst death, and all oblivious enmity\u8232 Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room\u8232 Even in the eyes of all posterity\u8232 That wear this world out to the ending doom.\u8232 So, till the judgment that yourself arise,\u8232 You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.\
Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said\uc0\u8232 Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,\u8232 Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,\u8232 To-morrow sharpened in his former might:\u8232 So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill\u8232 Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,\u8232 To-morrow see again, and do not kill\u8232 The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.\u8232 Let this sad interim like the ocean be\u8232 Which parts the shore, where two contracted new\u8232 Come daily to the banks, that when they see\u8232 Return of love, more blest may be the view;\u8232 As call it winter, which being full of care,\u8232 Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.\
Being your slave what should I do but tend\uc0\u8232 Upon the hours, and times of your desire?\u8232 I have no precious time at all to spend;\u8232 Nor services to do, till you require.\u8232 Nor dare I chide the world without end hour,\u8232 Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,\u8232 Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,\u8232 When you have bid your servant once adieu;\u8232 Nor dare I question with my jealous thought\u8232 Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,\u8232 But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought\u8232 Save, where you are, how happy you make those.\u8232 So true a fool is love, that in your will,\u8232 Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.\
That god forbid, that made me first your slave,\uc0\u8232 I should in thought control your times of pleasure,\u8232 Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,\u8232 Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!\u8232 O! let me suffer, being at your beck,\u8232 The imprison'd absence of your liberty;\u8232 And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,\u8232 Without accusing you of injury.\u8232 Be where you list, your charter is so strong\u8232 That you yourself may privilege your time\u8232 To what you will; to you it doth belong\u8232 Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.\u8232 I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,\u8232 Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.\
If there be nothing new, but that which is\uc0\u8232 Hath been before, how are our brains beguil'd,\u8232 Which labouring for invention bear amiss\u8232 The second burthen of a former child.\u8232 Oh that record could with a backward look,\u8232 Even of five hundred courses of the sun,\u8232 Show me your image in some antique book,\u8232 Since mind at first in character was done,\u8232 That I might see what the old world could say\u8232 To this composed wonder of your frame;\u8232 Whether we are mended, or where better they,\u8232 Or whether revolution be the same.\u8232 Oh sure I am the wits of former days,\u8232 To subjects worse have given admiring praise.\
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,\uc0\u8232 So do our minutes hasten to their end;\u8232 Each changing place with that which goes before,\u8232 In sequent toil all forwards do contend.\u8232 Nativity, once in the main of light,\u8232 Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,\u8232 Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,\u8232 And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.\u8232 Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth\u8232 And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,\u8232 Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,\u8232 And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:\u8232 And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand\u8232 Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.\
Is it thy will, thy image should keep open\uc0\u8232 My heavy eyelids to the weary night?\u8232 Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,\u8232 While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?\u8232 Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee\u8232 So far from home into my deeds to pry,\u8232 To find out shames and idle hours in me,\u8232 The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?\u8232 O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:\u8232 It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:\u8232 Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,\u8232 To play the watchman ever for thy sake:\u8232 For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,\u8232 From me far off, with others all too near.\
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye\uc0\u8232 And all my soul, and all my every part;\u8232 And for this sin there is no remedy,\u8232 It is so grounded inward in my heart.\u8232 Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,\u8232 No shape so true, no truth of such account;\u8232 And for myself mine own worth do define,\u8232 As I all other in all worths surmount.\u8232 But when my glass shows me myself indeed\u8232 Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,\u8232 Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;\u8232 Self so self-loving were iniquity.\u8232 'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,\u8232 Painting my age with beauty of thy days.\
Against my love shall be as I am now,\uc0\u8232 With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn;\u8232 When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow\u8232 With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn\u8232 Hath travelled on to age's steepy night;\u8232 And all those beauties whereof now he's king\u8232 Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,\u8232 Stealing away the treasure of his spring;\u8232 For such a time do I now fortify\u8232 Against confounding age's cruel knife,\u8232 That he shall never cut from memory\u8232 My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:\u8232 His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,\u8232 And they shall live, and he in them still green.\
When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced\uc0\u8232 The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;\u8232 When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed,\u8232 And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;\u8232 When I have seen the hungry ocean gain\u8232 Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,\u8232 And the firm soil win of the watery main,\u8232 Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;\u8232 When I have seen such interchange of state,\u8232 Or state itself confounded to decay;\u8232 Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate\u8232 That Time will come and take my love away.\u8232 This thought is as a death which cannot choose\u8232 But weep to have that which it fears to lose.\
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,\uc0\u8232 But sad mortality o'ersways their power,\u8232 How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,\u8232 Whose action is no stronger than a flower?\u8232 O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,\u8232 Against the wrackful siege of battering days,\u8232 When rocks impregnable are not so stout,\u8232 Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?\u8232 O fearful meditation! where, alack,\u8232 Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?\u8232 Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?\u8232 Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?\u8232 O! none, unless this miracle have might,\u8232 That in black ink my love may still shine bright.\
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,\uc0\u8232 As to behold desert a beggar born,\u8232 And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,\u8232 And purest faith unhappily forsworn,\u8232 And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,\u8232 And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,\u8232 And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,\u8232 And strength by limping sway disabled\u8232 And art made tongue-tied by authority,\u8232 And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,\u8232 And simple truth miscalled simplicity,\u8232 And captive good attending captain ill:\u8232 Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,\u8232 Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.\
Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,\uc0\u8232 And with his presence grace impiety,\u8232 That sin by him advantage should achieve,\u8232 And lace itself with his society?\u8232 Why should false painting imitate his cheek,\u8232 And steal dead seeming of his living hue?\u8232 Why should poor beauty indirectly seek\u8232 Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?\u8232 Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,\u8232 Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins?\u8232 For she hath no exchequer now but his,\u8232 And proud of many, lives upon his gains.\u8232 O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had\u8232 In days long since, before these last so bad.\
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,\uc0\u8232 When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,\u8232 Before these bastard signs of fair were born,\u8232 Or durst inhabit on a living brow;\u8232 Before the golden tresses of the dead,\u8232 The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,\u8232 To live a second life on second head;\u8232 Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:\u8232 In him those holy antique hours are seen,\u8232 Without all ornament, itself and true,\u8232 Making no summer of another's green,\u8232 Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;\u8232 And him as for a map doth Nature store,\u8232 To show false Art what beauty was of yore.\
Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view\uc0\u8232 Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;\u8232 All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,\u8232 Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.\u8232 Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;\u8232 But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,\u8232 In other accents do this praise confound\u8232 By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.\u8232 They look into the beauty of thy mind,\u8232 And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;\u8232 Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,\u8232 To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:\u8232 But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,\u8232 The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.\
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,\uc0\u8232 For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;\u8232 The ornament of beauty is suspect,\u8232 A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.\u8232 So thou be good, slander doth but approve\u8232 Thy worth the greater, being wooed of time;\u8232 For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,\u8232 And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.\u8232 Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days\u8232 Either not assailed, or victor being charged;\u8232 Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,\u8232 To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,\u8232 If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,\u8232 Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.\
No longer mourn for me when I am dead\uc0\u8232 Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell\u8232 Give warning to the world that I am fled\u8232 From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:\u8232 Nay, if you read this line, remember not\u8232 The hand that writ it, for I love you so,\u8232 That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,\u8232 If thinking on me then should make you woe.\u8232 O! if, I say, you look upon this verse,\u8232 When I perhaps compounded am with clay,\u8232 Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;\u8232 But let your love even with my life decay;\u8232 Lest the wise world should look into your moan,\u8232 And mock you with me after I am gone.\
O! lest the world should task you to recite\uc0\u8232 What merit lived in me, that you should love\u8232 After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,\u8232 For you in me can nothing worthy prove.\u8232 Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,\u8232 To do more for me than mine own desert,\u8232 And hang more praise upon deceased I\u8232 Than niggard truth would willingly impart:\u8232 O! lest your true love may seem false in this\u8232 That you for love speak well of me untrue,\u8232 My name be buried where my body is,\u8232 And live no more to shame nor me nor you.\u8232 For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,\u8232 And so should you, to love things nothing worth.\
That time of year thou mayst in me behold\uc0\u8232 When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\u8232 Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,\u8232 Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\u8232 In me thou see'st the twilight of such day\u8232 As after sunset fadeth in the west;\u8232 Which by and by black night doth take away,\u8232 Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.\u8232 In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,\u8232 That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\u8232 As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,\u8232 Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.\u8232 This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,\u8232 To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.\
But be contented when that fell arrest\uc0\u8232 Without all bail shall carry me away,\u8232 My life hath in this line some interest,\u8232 Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.\u8232 When thou reviewest this, thou dost review\u8232 The very part was consecrate to thee:\u8232 The earth can have but earth, which is his due;\u8232 My spirit is thine, the better part of me:\u8232 So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,\u8232 The prey of worms, my body being dead;\u8232 The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,\u8232 Too base of thee to be remembered.\u8232 The worth of that is that which it contains,\u8232 And that is this, and this with thee remains.\
So are you to my thoughts as food to life,\uc0\u8232 Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;\u8232 And for the peace of you I hold such strife\u8232 As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.\u8232 Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon\u8232 Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;\u8232 Now counting best to be with you alone,\u8232 Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:\u8232 Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,\u8232 And by and by clean starved for a look;\u8232 Possessing or pursuing no delight\u8232 Save what is had, or must from you be took.\u8232 Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,\u8232 Or gluttoning on all, or all away.\
Why is my verse so barren of new pride,\uc0\u8232 So far from variation or quick change?\u8232 Why with the time do I not glance aside\u8232 To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?\u8232 Why write I still all one, ever the same,\u8232 And keep invention in a noted weed,\u8232 That every word doth almost tell my name,\u8232 Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?\u8232 O! know sweet love I always write of you,\u8232 And you and love are still my argument;\u8232 So all my best is dressing old words new,\u8232 Spending again what is already spent:\u8232 For as the sun is daily new and old,\u8232 So is my love still telling what is told.\
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,\uc0\u8232 Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;\u8232 The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,\u8232 And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.\u8232 The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show\u8232 Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;\u8232 Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know\u8232 Time's thievish progress to eternity.\u8232 Look what thy memory cannot contain,\u8232 Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find\u8232 Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,\u8232 To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.\u8232 These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,\u8232 Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.\
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,\uc0\u8232 And found such fair assistance in my verse\u8232 As every alien pen hath got my use\u8232 And under thee their poesy disperse.\u8232 Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing\u8232 And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,\u8232 Have added feathers to the learned's wing\u8232 And given grace a double majesty.\u8232 Yet be most proud of that which I compile,\u8232 Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:\u8232 In others' works thou dost but mend the style,\u8232 And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;\u8232 But thou art all my art, and dost advance\u8232 As high as learning, my rude ignorance.\
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,\uc0\u8232 My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;\u8232 But now my gracious numbers are decayed,\u8232 And my sick Muse doth give an other place.\u8232 I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument\u8232 Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;\u8232 Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent\u8232 He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.\u8232 He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word\u8232 From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,\u8232 And found it in thy cheek: he can afford\u8232 No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.\u8232 Then thank him not for that which he doth say,\u8232 Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.\
O! how I faint when I of you do write,\uc0\u8232 Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,\u8232 And in the praise thereof spends all his might,\u8232 To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.\u8232 But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,\u8232 The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,\u8232 My saucy bark, inferior far to his,\u8232 On your broad main doth wilfully appear.\u8232 Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,\u8232 Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;\u8232 Or, being wracked, I am a worthless boat,\u8232 He of tall building, and of goodly pride:\u8232 Then if he thrive and I be cast away,\u8232 The worst was this, my love was my decay.\
Or I shall live your epitaph to make,\uc0\u8232 Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,\u8232 From hence your memory death cannot take,\u8232 Although in me each part will be forgotten.\u8232 Your name from hence immortal life shall have,\u8232 Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:\u8232 The earth can yield me but a common grave,\u8232 When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.\u8232 Your monument shall be my gentle verse,\u8232 Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;\u8232 And tongues to be your being shall rehearse,\u8232 When all the breathers of this world are dead;\u8232 You still shall live, such virtue hath my pen,\u8232 Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.\
I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,\uc0\u8232 And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook\u8232 The dedicated words which writers use\u8232 Of their fair subject, blessing every book.\u8232 Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,\u8232 Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;\u8232 And therefore art enforced to seek anew\u8232 Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.\u8232 And do so, love; yet when they have devised,\u8232 What strained touches rhetoric can lend,\u8232 Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized\u8232 In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;\u8232 And their gross painting might be better used\u8232 Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.\
I never saw that you did painting need,\uc0\u8232 And therefore to your fair no painting set;\u8232 I found, or thought I found, you did exceed\u8232 The barren tender of a poet's debt:\u8232 And therefore have I slept in your report,\u8232 That you yourself, being extant, well might show\u8232 How far a modern quill doth come too short,\u8232 Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.\u8232 This silence for my sin you did impute,\u8232 Which shall be most my glory being dumb;\u8232 For I impair not beauty being mute,\u8232 When others would give life, and bring a tomb.\u8232 There lives more life in one of your fair eyes\u8232 Than both your poets can in praise devise.\
Who is it that says most, which can say more,\uc0\u8232 Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you,\u8232 In whose confine immured is the store\u8232 Which should example where your equal grew?\u8232 Lean penury within that pen doth dwell\u8232 That to his subject lends not some small glory;\u8232 But he that writes of you, if he can tell\u8232 That you are you, so dignifies his story.\u8232 Let him but copy what in you is writ,\u8232 Not making worse what nature made so clear,\u8232 And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,\u8232 Making his style admired every where.\u8232 You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,\u8232 Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.\
My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,\uc0\u8232 While comments of your praise richly compiled,\u8232 Reserve thy character with golden quill,\u8232 And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.\u8232 I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,\u8232 And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen\u8232 To every hymn that able spirit affords,\u8232 In polished form of well-refined pen.\u8232 Hearing you praised, I say tis so, tis true,\u8232 And to the most of praise add something more;\u8232 But that is in my thought, whose love to you,\u8232 Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.\u8232 Then others, for the breath of words respect,\u8232 Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.\
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,\uc0\u8232 Bound for the prize of all too precious you,\u8232 That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,\u8232 Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?\u8232 Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write\u8232 Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?\u8232 No, neither he, nor his compeers by night\u8232 Giving him aid, my verse astonished.\u8232 He, nor that affable familiar ghost\u8232 Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,\u8232 As victors of my silence cannot boast;\u8232 I was not sick of any fear from thence:\u8232 But when your countenance filled up his line,\u8232 Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.\
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,\uc0\u8232 And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,\u8232 The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;\u8232 My bonds in thee are all determinate.\u8232 For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?\u8232 And for that riches where is my deserving?\u8232 The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,\u8232 And so my patent back again is swerving.\u8232 Thy self thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,\u8232 Or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking;\u8232 So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,\u8232 Comes home again, on better judgement making.\u8232 Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,\u8232 In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.\
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,\uc0\u8232 And place my merit in the eye of scorn,\u8232 Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,\u8232 And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.\u8232 With mine own weakness being best acquainted,\u8232 Upon thy part I can set down a story\u8232 Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted;\u8232 That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:\u8232 And I by this will be a gainer too;\u8232 For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,\u8232 The injuries that to myself I do,\u8232 Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.\u8232 Such is my love, to thee I so belong,\u8232 That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.\
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,\uc0\u8232 And I will comment upon that offence:\u8232 Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,\u8232 Against thy reasons making no defence.\u8232 Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,\u8232 To set a form upon desired change,\u8232 As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,\u8232 I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;\u8232 Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue\u8232 Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,\u8232 Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,\u8232 And haply of our old acquaintance tell.\u8232 For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,\u8232 For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.\
Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;\uc0\u8232 Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,\u8232 Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,\u8232 And do not drop in for an after-loss:\u8232 Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,\u8232 Come in the rearward of a conquered woe;\u8232 Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,\u8232 To linger out a purposed overthrow.\u8232 If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,\u8232 When other petty griefs have done their spite,\u8232 But in the onset come: so shall I taste\u8232 At first the very worst of fortune's might;\u8232 And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,\u8232 Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.\
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,\uc0\u8232 Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,\u8232 Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;\u8232 Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;\u8232 And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,\u8232 Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:\u8232 But these particulars are not my measure,\u8232 All these I better in one general best.\u8232 Thy love is better than high birth to me,\u8232 Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,\u8232 Of more delight than hawks and horses be;\u8232 And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:\u8232 Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take\u8232 All this away, and me most wretched make.\
But do thy worst to steal thyself away,\uc0\u8232 For term of life thou art assured mine;\u8232 And life no longer than thy love will stay,\u8232 For it depends upon that love of thine.\u8232 Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,\u8232 When in the least of them my life hath end.\u8232 I see a better state to me belongs\u8232 Than that which on thy humour doth depend:\u8232 Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,\u8232 Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.\u8232 O what a happy title do I find,\u8232 Happy to have thy love, happy to die!\u8232 But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?\u8232 Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.\
So shall I live, supposing thou art true,\uc0\u8232 Like a deceived husband; so love's face\u8232 May still seem love to me, though altered new;\u8232 Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:\u8232 For there can live no hatred in thine eye,\u8232 Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.\u8232 In many's looks, the false heart's history\u8232 Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.\u8232 But heaven in thy creation did decree\u8232 That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;\u8232 Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,\u8232 Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.\u8232 How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,\u8232 If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!\
They that have power to hurt, and will do none,\uc0\u8232 That do not do the thing they most do show,\u8232 Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,\u8232 Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;\u8232 They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,\u8232 And husband nature's riches from expense;\u8232 They are the lords and owners of their faces,\u8232 Others, but stewards of their excellence.\u8232 The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,\u8232 Though to itself, it only live and die,\u8232 But if that flower with base infection meet,\u8232 The basest weed outbraves his dignity:\u8232 For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;\u8232 Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.\
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame\uc0\u8232 Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,\u8232 Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!\u8232 O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.\u8232 That tongue that tells the story of thy days,\u8232 Making lascivious comments on thy sport,\u8232 Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;\u8232 Naming thy name blesses an ill report.\u8232 O! what a mansion have those vices got\u8232 Which for their habitation chose out thee,\u8232 Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot\u8232 And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!\u8232 Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;\u8232 The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.\
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;\uc0\u8232 Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;\u8232 Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:\u8232 Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.\u8232 As on the finger of a throned queen\u8232 The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,\u8232 So are those errors that in thee are seen\u8232 To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.\u8232 How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,\u8232 If like a lamb he could his looks translate!\u8232 How many gazers mightst thou lead away,\u8232 If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!\u8232 But do not so, I love thee in such sort,\u8232 As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\
How like a winter hath my absence been\uc0\u8232 From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!\u8232 What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!\u8232 What old December's bareness everywhere!\u8232 And yet this time removed was summer's time;\u8232 The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,\u8232 Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,\u8232 Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:\u8232 Yet this abundant issue seemed to me\u8232 But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit;\u8232 For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,\u8232 And, thou away, the very birds are mute:\u8232 Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,\u8232 That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.\
From you have I been absent in the spring,\uc0\u8232 When proud pied April, dressed in all his trim,\u8232 Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,\u8232 That heavy Saturn laughed and leapt with him.\u8232 Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell\u8232 Of different flowers in odour and in hue,\u8232 Could make me any summer's story tell,\u8232 Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:\u8232 Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,\u8232 Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;\u8232 They were but sweet, but figures of delight,\u8232 Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.\u8232 Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,\u8232 As with your shadow I with these did play.\
The forward violet thus did I chide:\uc0\u8232 Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,\u8232 If not from my love's breath? The purple pride\u8232 Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells\u8232 In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.\u8232 The lily I condemned for thy hand,\u8232 And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;\u8232 The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,\u8232 One blushing shame, another white despair;\u8232 A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,\u8232 And to his robbery had annexed thy breath;\u8232 But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth\u8232 A vengeful canker eat him up to death.\u8232 More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,\u8232 But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.\
Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,\uc0\u8232 To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?\u8232 Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,\u8232 Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?\u8232 Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,\u8232 In gentle numbers time so idly spent;\u8232 Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem\u8232 And gives thy pen both skill and argument.\u8232 Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,\u8232 If Time have any wrinkle graven there;\u8232 If any, be a satire to decay,\u8232 And make Time's spoils despised every where.\u8232 Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,\u8232 So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.\
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends\uc0\u8232 For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?\u8232 Both truth and beauty on my love depends;\u8232 So dost thou too, and therein dignified.\u8232 Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say,\u8232 'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fixed;\u8232 Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;\u8232 But best is best, if never intermixed'?\u8232 Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?\u8232 Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee\u8232 To make him much outlive a gilded tomb\u8232 And to be praised of ages yet to be.\u8232 Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how\u8232 To make him seem, long hence, as he shows now.\
My love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming;\uc0\u8232 I love not less, though less the show appear;\u8232 That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,\u8232 The owner's tongue doth publish every where.\u8232 Our love was new, and then but in the spring,\u8232 When I was wont to greet it with my lays;\u8232 As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,\u8232 And stops his pipe in growth of riper days:\u8232 Not that the summer is less pleasant now\u8232 Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,\u8232 But that wild music burthens every bough,\u8232 And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.\u8232 Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:\u8232 Because I would not dull you with my song.\
Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,\uc0\u8232 That having such a scope to show her pride,\u8232 The argument all bare is of more worth\u8232 Than when it hath my added praise beside!\u8232 O! blame me not, if I no more can write!\u8232 Look in your glass, and there appears a face\u8232 That over-goes my blunt invention quite,\u8232 Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.\u8232 Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,\u8232 To mar the subject that before was well?\u8232 For to no other pass my verses tend\u8232 Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;\u8232 And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,\u8232 Your own glass shows you when you look in it.\
To me, fair friend, you never can be old,\uc0\u8232 For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,\u8232 Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,\u8232 Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,\u8232 Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,\u8232 In process of the seasons have I seen,\u8232 Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,\u8232 Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.\u8232 Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,\u8232 Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;\u8232 So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,\u8232 Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:\u8232 For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:\u8232 Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.\
Let not my love be called idolatry,\uc0\u8232 Nor my beloved as an idol show,\u8232 Since all alike my songs and praises be\u8232 To one, of one, still such, and ever so.\u8232 Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,\u8232 Still constant in a wondrous excellence;\u8232 Therefore my verse to constancy confined,\u8232 One thing expressing, leaves out difference.\u8232 Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,\u8232 Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words;\u8232 And in this change is my invention spent,\u8232 Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.\u8232 Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone,\u8232 Which three till now, never kept seat in one.\
When in the chronicle of wasted time\uc0\u8232 I see descriptions of the fairest wights,\u8232 And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,\u8232 In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,\u8232 Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,\u8232 Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,\u8232 I see their antique pen would have expressed\u8232 Even such a beauty as you master now.\u8232 So all their praises are but prophecies\u8232 Of this our time, all you prefiguring;\u8232 And for they looked but with divining eyes,\u8232 They had not skill enough your worth to sing:\u8232 For we, which now behold these present days,\u8232 Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.\
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul\uc0\u8232 Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,\u8232 Can yet the lease of my true love control,\u8232 Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.\u8232 The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,\u8232 And the sad augurs mock their own presage;\u8232 Incertainties now crown themselves assured,\u8232 And peace proclaims olives of endless age.\u8232 Now with the drops of this most balmy time,\u8232 My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,\u8232 Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,\u8232 While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:\u8232 And thou in this shalt find thy monument,\u8232 When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.\
What's in the brain that ink may character\uc0\u8232 Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?\u8232 What's new to speak, what now to register,\u8232 That may express my love, or thy dear merit?\u8232 Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,\u8232 I must each day say o'er the very same;\u8232 Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,\u8232 Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.\u8232 So that eternal love in love's fresh case,\u8232 Weighs not the dust and injury of age,\u8232 Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,\u8232 But makes antiquity for aye his page;\u8232 Finding the first conceit of love there bred,\u8232 Where time and outward form would show it dead.\
O! never say that I was false of heart,\uc0\u8232 Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,\u8232 As easy might I from my self depart\u8232 As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:\u8232 That is my home of love: if I have ranged,\u8232 Like him that travels, I return again;\u8232 Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,\u8232 So that myself bring water for my stain.\u8232 Never believe though in my nature reigned,\u8232 All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,\u8232 That it could so preposterously be stained,\u8232 To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;\u8232 For nothing this wide universe I call,\u8232 Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.\
Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,\uc0\u8232 And made my self a motley to the view,\u8232 Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,\u8232 Made old offences of affections new;\u8232 Most true it is, that I have looked on truth\u8232 Askance and strangely; but, by all above,\u8232 These blenches gave my heart another youth,\u8232 And worse essays proved thee my best of love.\u8232 Now all is done, have what shall have no end:\u8232 Mine appetite I never more will grind\u8232 On newer proof, to try an older friend,\u8232 A god in love, to whom I am confined.\u8232 Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,\u8232 Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.\
O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,\uc0\u8232 The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,\u8232 That did not better for my life provide\u8232 Than public means which public manners breeds.\u8232 Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,\u8232 And almost thence my nature is subdued\u8232 To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:\u8232 Pity me, then, and wish I were renewed;\u8232 Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink\u8232 Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;\u8232 No bitterness that I will bitter think,\u8232 Nor double penance, to correct correction.\u8232 Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,\u8232 Even that your pity is enough to cure me.\
Your love and pity doth the impression fill,\uc0\u8232 Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow;\u8232 For what care I who calls me well or ill,\u8232 So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?\u8232 You are my all-the-world, and I must strive\u8232 To know my shames and praises from your tongue;\u8232 None else to me, nor I to none alive,\u8232 That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.\u8232 In so profound abysm I throw all care\u8232 Of others' voices, that my adder's sense\u8232 To critic and to flatterer stopped are.\u8232 Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:\u8232 You are so strongly in my purpose bred,\u8232 That all the world besides methinks y'are dead.\
Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;\uc0\u8232 And that which governs me to go about\u8232 Doth part his function and is partly blind,\u8232 Seems seeing, but effectually is out;\u8232 For it no form delivers to the heart\u8232 Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:\u8232 Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,\u8232 Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;\u8232 For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,\u8232 The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,\u8232 The mountain or the sea, the day or night,\u8232 The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.\u8232 Incapable of more, replete with you,\u8232 My most true mind thus maketh mine eye untrue.\
Or whether doth my mind, being crowned with you,\uc0\u8232 Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?\u8232 Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,\u8232 And that your love taught it this alchemy,\u8232 To make of monsters and things indigest\u8232 Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,\u8232 Creating every bad a perfect best,\u8232 As fast as objects to his beams assemble?\u8232 O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,\u8232 And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:\u8232 Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,\u8232 And to his palate doth prepare the cup:\u8232 If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin\u8232 That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.\
Those lines that I before have writ do lie,\uc0\u8232 Even those that said I could not love you dearer:\u8232 Yet then my judgment knew no reason why\u8232 My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.\u8232 But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents\u8232 Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,\u8232 Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,\u8232 Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;\u8232 Alas! why, fearing of Time's tyranny,\u8232 Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'\u8232 When I was certain o'er incertainty,\u8232 Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?\u8232 Love is a babe, then might I not say so,\u8232 To give full growth to that which still doth grow?\
Let me not to the marriage of true minds\uc0\u8232 Admit impediments. Love is not love\u8232 Which alters when it alteration finds,\u8232 Or bends with the remover to remove:\u8232 O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,\u8232 That looks on tempests and is never shaken;\u8232 It is the star to every wandering bark,\u8232 Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.\u8232 Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks\u8232 Within his bending sickle's compass come;\u8232 Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,\u8232 But bears it out even to the edge of doom.\u8232 If this be error and upon me proved,\u8232 I never writ, nor no man ever loved.\
Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,\uc0\u8232 Wherein I should your great deserts repay,\u8232 Forgot upon your dearest love to call,\u8232 Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;\u8232 That I have frequent been with unknown minds,\u8232 And given to time your own dear-purchased right;\u8232 That I have hoisted sail to all the winds\u8232 Which should transport me farthest from your sight.\u8232 Book both my wilfulness and errors down,\u8232 And on just proof surmise accumulate;\u8232 Bring me within the level of your frown,\u8232 But shoot not at me in your wakened hate;\u8232 Since my appeal says I did strive to prove\u8232 The constancy and virtue of your love.\
Like as, to make our appetites more keen,\uc0\u8232 With eager compounds we our palate urge;\u8232 As, to prevent our maladies unseen,\u8232 We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;\u8232 Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,\u8232 To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;\u8232 And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness\u8232 To be diseased, ere that there was true needing.\u8232 Thus policy in love, to anticipate\u8232 The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,\u8232 And brought to medicine a healthful state\u8232 Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured;\u8232 But thence I learn and find the lesson true,\u8232 Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.\
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,\uc0\u8232 Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,\u8232 Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,\u8232 Still losing when I saw myself to win!\u8232 What wretched errors hath my heart committed,\u8232 Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!\u8232 How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,\u8232 In the distraction of this madding fever!\u8232 O benefit of ill! now I find true\u8232 That better is by evil still made better;\u8232 And ruined love, when it is built anew,\u8232 Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.\u8232 So I return rebuked to my content,\u8232 And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.\
That you were once unkind befriends me now,\uc0\u8232 And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,\u8232 Needs must I under my transgression bow,\u8232 Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.\u8232 For if you were by my unkindness shaken,\u8232 As I by yours, you've passed a hell of time;\u8232 And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken\u8232 To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.\u8232 O! that our night of woe might have remembered\u8232 My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,\u8232 And soon to you, as you to me, then tendered\u8232 The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!\u8232 But that your trespass now becomes a fee;\u8232 Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.\
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,\uc0\u8232 When not to be receives reproach of being;\u8232 And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed\u8232 Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing:\u8232 For why should others' false adulterate eyes\u8232 Give salutation to my sportive blood?\u8232 Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,\u8232 Which in their wills count bad what I think good?\u8232 No, I am that I am, and they that level\u8232 At my abuses reckon up their own:\u8232 I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;\u8232 By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;\u8232 Unless this general evil they maintain,\u8232 All men are bad and in their badness reign.\
Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain\uc0\u8232 Full charactered with lasting memory,\u8232 Which shall above that idle rank remain,\u8232 Beyond all date, even to eternity:\u8232 Or, at the least, so long as brain and heart\u8232 Have faculty by nature to subsist;\u8232 Till each to razed oblivion yield his part\u8232 Of thee, thy record never can be missed.\u8232 That poor retention could not so much hold,\u8232 Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;\u8232 Therefore to give them from me was I bold,\u8232 To trust those tables that receive thee more:\u8232 To keep an adjunct to remember thee\u8232 Were to import forgetfulness in me.\
No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:\uc0\u8232 Thy pyramids built up with newer might\u8232 To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;\u8232 They are but dressings of a former sight.\u8232 Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire\u8232 What thou dost foist upon us that is old;\u8232 And rather make them born to our desire\u8232 Than think that we before have heard them told.\u8232 Thy registers and thee I both defy,\u8232 Not wondering at the present nor the past,\u8232 For thy records and what we see doth lie,\u8232 Made more or less by thy continual haste.\u8232 This I do vow and this shall ever be;\u8232 I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.\
If my dear love were but the child of state,\uc0\u8232 It might for Fortune's bastard be unfathered,\u8232 As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,\u8232 Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.\u8232 No, it was builded far from accident;\u8232 It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls\u8232 Under the blow of thralled discontent,\u8232 Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:\u8232 It fears not policy, that heretic,\u8232 Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,\u8232 But all alone stands hugely politic,\u8232 That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.\u8232 To this I witness call the fools of time,\u8232 Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.\
Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,\uc0\u8232 With my extern the outward honouring,\u8232 Or laid great bases for eternity,\u8232 Which proves more short than waste or ruining?\u8232 Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour\u8232 Lose all and more by paying too much rent\u8232 For compound sweet, forgoing simple savour,\u8232 Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?\u8232 No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,\u8232 And take thou my oblation, poor but free,\u8232 Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,\u8232 But mutual render, only me for thee.\u8232 Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul\u8232 When most impeached stands least in thy control.\
O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power\uc0\u8232 Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;\u8232 Who hast by waning grown, and therein showest\u8232 Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growest.\u8232 If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,\u8232 As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,\u8232 She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill\u8232 May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.\u8232 Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!\u8232 She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:\u8232 Her audit though delayed answered must be,\u8232 And her quietus is to render thee.\
In the old age black was not counted fair,\uc0\u8232 Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;\u8232 But now is black beauty's successive heir,\u8232 And beauty slandered with a bastard shame:\u8232 For since each hand hath put on Nature's power,\u8232 Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,\u8232 Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,\u8232 But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.\u8232 Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,\u8232 Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem\u8232 At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,\u8232 Sland'ring creation with a false esteem:\u8232 Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,\u8232 That every tongue says beauty should look so.\
How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,\uc0\u8232 Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds\u8232 With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st\u8232 The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,\u8232 Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,\u8232 To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,\u8232 Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,\u8232 At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!\u8232 To be so tickled, they would change their state\u8232 And situation with those dancing chips,\u8232 O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,\u8232 Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips.\u8232 Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,\u8232 Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.\
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame\uc0\u8232 Is lust in action: and till action, lust\u8232 Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,\u8232 Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;\u8232 Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight;\u8232 Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,\u8232 Past reason hated, as a swallowed bait,\u8232 On purpose laid to make the taker mad.\u8232 Mad in pursuit and in possession so;\u8232 Had, having, and in quest to have extreme;\u8232 A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;\u8232 Before, a joy proposed; behind a dream.\u8232 All this the world well knows; yet none knows well\u8232 To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.\
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;\uc0\u8232 Coral is far more red, than her lips red:\u8232 If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;\u8232 If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.\u8232 I have seen roses damasked, red and white,\u8232 But no such roses see I in her cheeks;\u8232 And in some perfumes is there more delight\u8232 Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.\u8232 I love to hear her speak, yet well I know\u8232 That music hath a far more pleasing sound:\u8232 I grant I never saw a goddess go,\u8232 My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:\u8232 And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,\u8232 As any she belied with false compare.\
Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,\uc0\u8232 As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;\u8232 For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart\u8232 Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.\u8232 Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,\u8232 Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;\u8232 To say they err I dare not be so bold,\u8232 Although I swear it to myself alone.\u8232 And to be sure that is not false I swear,\u8232 A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,\u8232 One on another's neck, do witness bear\u8232 Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.\u8232 In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,\u8232 And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.\
Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,\uc0\u8232 Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,\u8232 Have put on black and loving mourners be,\u8232 Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.\u8232 And truly not the morning sun of heaven\u8232 Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,\u8232 Nor that full star that ushers in the even,\u8232 Doth half that glory to the sober west,\u8232 As those two mourning eyes become thy face:\u8232 O! let it then as well beseem thy heart\u8232 To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,\u8232 And suit thy pity like in every part.\u8232 Then will I swear beauty herself is black,\u8232 And all they foul that thy complexion lack.\
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan\uc0\u8232 For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!\u8232 Is't not enough to torture me alone,\u8232 But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?\u8232 Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,\u8232 And my next self thou harder hast engrossed:\u8232 Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;\u8232 A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed.\u8232 Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,\u8232 But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;\u8232 Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;\u8232 Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:\u8232 And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,\u8232 Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.\
So now I have confessed that he is thine,\uc0\u8232 And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,\u8232 Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine\u8232 Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:\u8232 But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,\u8232 For thou art covetous, and he is kind;\u8232 He learned but surety-like to write for me,\u8232 Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.\u8232 The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,\u8232 Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,\u8232 And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;\u8232 So him I lose through my unkind abuse.\u8232 Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:\u8232 He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.\
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,\uc0\u8232 And Will to boot, and Will in over-plus;\u8232 More than enough am I that vexed thee still,\u8232 To thy sweet will making addition thus.\u8232 Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,\u8232 Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?\u8232 Shall will in others seem right gracious,\u8232 And in my will no fair acceptance shine?\u8232 The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,\u8232 And in abundance addeth to his store;\u8232 So thou, being rich in Will, add to thy Will\u8232 One will of mine, to make thy large will more.\u8232 Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;\u8232 Think all but one, and me in that one Will.\
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,\uc0\u8232 Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will,\u8232 And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;\u8232 Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.\u8232 Will, will fulfil the treasure of thy love,\u8232 Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.\u8232 In things of great receipt with ease we prove\u8232 Among a number one is reckoned none:\u8232 Then in the number let me pass untold,\u8232 Though in thy store's account I one must be;\u8232 For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold\u8232 That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:\u8232 Make but my name thy love, and love that still,\u8232 And then thou lovest me for my name is Will.\
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,\uc0\u8232 That they behold, and see not what they see?\u8232 They know what beauty is, see where it lies,\u8232 Yet what the best is take the worst to be.\u8232 If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,\u8232 Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,\u8232 Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,\u8232 Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?\u8232 Why should my heart think that a several plot,\u8232 Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?\u8232 Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,\u8232 To put fair truth upon so foul a face?\u8232 In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,\u8232 And to this false plague are they now transferred.\
When my love swears that she is made of truth,\uc0\u8232 I do believe her though I know she lies,\u8232 That she might think me some untutored youth,\u8232 Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.\u8232 Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,\u8232 Although she knows my days are past the best,\u8232 Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:\u8232 On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:\u8232 But wherefore says she not she is unjust?\u8232 And wherefore say not I that I am old?\u8232 O! love's best habit is in seeming trust,\u8232 And age in love, loves not to have years told:\u8232 Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,\u8232 And in our faults by lies we flattered be.\
O! call not me to justify the wrong\uc0\u8232 That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;\u8232 Wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue:\u8232 Use power with power, and slay me not by art,\u8232 Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,\u8232 Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:\u8232 What need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy might\u8232 Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?\u8232 Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows\u8232 Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;\u8232 And therefore from my face she turns my foes,\u8232 That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:\u8232 Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,\u8232 Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.\
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press\uc0\u8232 My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;\u8232 Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express\u8232 The manner of my pity-wanting pain.\u8232 If I might teach thee wit, better it were,\u8232 Though not to love, yet, love to tell me so;\u8232 As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,\u8232 No news but health from their physicians know;\u8232 For, if I should despair, I should grow mad,\u8232 And in my madness might speak ill of thee;\u8232 Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,\u8232 Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.\u8232 That I may not be so, nor thou belied,\u8232 Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.\
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,\uc0\u8232 For they in thee a thousand errors note;\u8232 But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,\u8232 Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote.\u8232 Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted;\u8232 Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,\u8232 Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited\u8232 To any sensual feast with thee alone:\u8232 But my five wits nor my five senses can\u8232 Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,\u8232 Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,\u8232 Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:\u8232 Only my plague thus far I count my gain,\u8232 That she that makes me sin awards me pain.\
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,\uc0\u8232 Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:\u8232 O! but with mine compare thou thine own state,\u8232 And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;\u8232 Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,\u8232 That have profaned their scarlet ornaments\u8232 And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,\u8232 Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.\u8232 Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lov'st those\u8232 Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:\u8232 Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,\u8232 Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.\u8232 If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,\u8232 By self-example mayst thou be denied!\
Lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch\uc0\u8232 One of her feathered creatures broke away,\u8232 Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch\u8232 In pursuit of the thing she would have stay;\u8232 Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,\u8232 Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent\u8232 To follow that which flies before her face,\u8232 Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;\u8232 So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,\u8232 Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;\u8232 But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,\u8232 And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind;\u8232 So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,\u8232 If thou turn back and my loud crying still.\
Two loves I have of comfort and despair,\uc0\u8232 Which like two spirits do suggest me still:\u8232 The better angel is a man right fair,\u8232 The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.\u8232 To win me soon to hell, my female evil,\u8232 Tempteth my better angel from my side,\u8232 And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,\u8232 Wooing his purity with her foul pride.\u8232 And whether that my angel be turned fiend,\u8232 Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;\u8232 But being both from me, both to each friend,\u8232 I guess one angel in another's hell:\u8232 Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,\u8232 Till my bad angel fire my good one out.\
Those lips that Love's own hand did make,\uc0\u8232 Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',\u8232 To me that languished for her sake:\u8232 But when she saw my woeful state,\u8232 Straight in her heart did mercy come,\u8232 Chiding that tongue that ever sweet\u8232 Was used in giving gentle doom;\u8232 And taught it thus anew to greet;\u8232 'I hate' she altered with an end,\u8232 That followed it as gentle day,\u8232 Doth follow night, who like a fiend\u8232 From heaven to hell is flown away.\u8232 'I hate', from hate away she threw,\u8232 And saved my life, saying not you.\
Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,\uc0\u8232 My sinful earth these rebel powers that thee array\u8232 Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,\u8232 Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?\u8232 Why so large cost, having so short a lease,\u8232 Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?\u8232 Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,\u8232 Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?\u8232 Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,\u8232 And let that pine to aggravate thy store;\u8232 Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;\u8232 Within be fed, without be rich no more:\u8232 So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,\u8232 And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.\
My love is as a fever longing still,\uc0\u8232 For that which longer nurseth the disease;\u8232 Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\u8232 The uncertain sickly appetite to please.\u8232 My reason, the physician to my love,\u8232 Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,\u8232 Hath left me, and I desperate now approve\u8232 Desire is death, which physic did except.\u8232 Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,\u8232 And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;\u8232 My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,\u8232 At random from the truth vainly expressed;\u8232 For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,\u8232 Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.\
O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,\uc0\u8232 Which have no correspondence with true sight;\u8232 Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,\u8232 That censures falsely what they see aright?\u8232 If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,\u8232 What means the world to say it is not so?\u8232 If it be not, then love doth well denote\u8232 Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,\u8232 How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,\u8232 That is so vexed with watching and with tears?\u8232 No marvel then, though I mistake my view;\u8232 The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.\u8232 O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,\u8232 Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.\
Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,\uc0\u8232 When I against myself with thee partake?\u8232 Do I not think on thee, when I forgot\u8232 Am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?\u8232 Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,\u8232 On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,\u8232 Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend\u8232 Revenge upon myself with present moan?\u8232 What merit do I in my self respect,\u8232 That is so proud thy service to despise,\u8232 When all my best doth worship thy defect,\u8232 Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?\u8232 But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind,\u8232 Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.\
O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,\uc0\u8232 With insufficiency my heart to sway?\u8232 To make me give the lie to my true sight,\u8232 And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?\u8232 Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,\u8232 That in the very refuse of thy deeds\u8232 There is such strength and warrantise of skill,\u8232 That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?\u8232 Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,\u8232 The more I hear and see just cause of hate?\u8232 O! though I love what others do abhor,\u8232 With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:\u8232 If thy unworthiness raised love in me,\u8232 More worthy I to be beloved of thee.\
Love is too young to know what conscience is,\uc0\u8232 Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?\u8232 Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,\u8232 Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:\u8232 For, thou betraying me, I do betray\u8232 My nobler part to my gross body's treason;\u8232 My soul doth tell my body that he may\u8232 Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,\u8232 But rising at thy name doth point out thee,\u8232 As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,\u8232 He is contented thy poor drudge to be,\u8232 To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.\u8232 No want of conscience hold it that I call\u8232 Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.\
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,\uc0\u8232 But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;\u8232 In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,\u8232 In vowing new hate after new love bearing:\u8232 But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,\u8232 When I break twenty? I am perjured most;\u8232 For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,\u8232 And all my honest faith in thee is lost:\u8232 For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,\u8232 Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;\u8232 And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,\u8232 Or made them swear against the thing they see;\u8232 For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured eye,\u8232 To swear against the truth so foul a lie!\
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:\uc0\u8232 A maid of Dian's this advantage found,\u8232 And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep\u8232 In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;\u8232 Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,\u8232 A dateless lively heat, still to endure,\u8232 And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove\u8232 Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.\u8232 But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,\u8232 The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;\u8232 I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,\u8232 And thither hied, a sad distempered guest,\u8232 But found no cure, the bath for my help lies\u8232 Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.\
The little Love-god lying once asleep,\uc0\u8232 Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,\u8232 Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep\u8232 Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand\u8232 The fairest votary took up that fire\u8232 Which many legions of true hearts had warmed;\u8232 And so the General of hot desire\u8232 Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarmed.\u8232 This brand she quenched in a cool well by,\u8232 Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,\u8232 Growing a bath and healthful remedy,\u8232 For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,\u8232 Came there for cure and this by that I prove,\u8232 Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.}
